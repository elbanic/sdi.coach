Sentence Splitter Module

The SentenceSplitter class splits text into sentences for streaming TTS processing.

Supports:
1. Korean sentence endings: 다, 요, 죠, 습니다, 세요, 네요, 거예요 + . ? !
2. English sentence endings: . ? !
3. Mixed Korean/English text
4. Punctuation preservation in output
5. Edge cases: abbreviations, numbers, quotes, URLs
